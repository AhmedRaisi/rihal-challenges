Here's a quick overview of the challenges I've tackled, along with brief descriptions of my approach and solutions:

### Data Engineers 

**Status**: Completed

[View Challenge](https://github.com/rihal-om/rihal-challenges/tree/main/data_engineering)

_Brief Description_: In the OCR Challenge for Data Engineering, I developed a Python-based software solution using Pytesseract for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract and standardize key information from images, including dates, room names, rates, individual names, and email addresses. The project involved applying regular expressions for accurate data extraction and pattern matching, coupled with data cleaning techniques to ensure the standardization of formats, particularly for dates and names. Key skills demonstrated included adept Python programming for data manipulation, problem-solving through debugging OCR accuracy issues, and maintaining clear, well-documented code for readability and collaboration. This solution effectively automated data extraction, highlighting the practical use of OCR technology and data engineering in processing and standardizing complex data from images.

_Brief Description_:

### Full-Stack Web Developers 

**Status**: In Progress 

[View Challenge](https://github.com/rihal-om/rihal-challenges/tree/main/devops)

_Brief Description_: For the Rihal DevOps Challenge, I engineered a full-stack web application utilizing Vue.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, which was containerized using Docker for data management. The application features a responsive front-end interface, RESTful backend services, and CRUD operations on a local database that initializes upon startup. Key functionalities include displaying statistics like student counts per class and country, and computing the average age of students. This project exemplified core skills in full-stack development, including front-end and server-side programming, database integration, and application of best coding practices. The addition of a theme toggle further demonstrates a commitment to user accessibility and modern web design. The codebase, managed on GitHub, showcases well-documented and maintainable code for collaborative development and review. This solution effectively addresses the challenge requirements, showcasing the versatility and integration of modern web technologies for educational data management.

### RPA Developer 

**Status**: Completed
